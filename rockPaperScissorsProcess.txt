    PSEUDOCODE:
    #set variable keepPlaying to true
    #While keepPlaying is true:
        #print statement welcomimg players to the game
        #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 Press 'q' to quit)
        # make a key that assigns a number to each choice fr the computer
        #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
        #import the random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from this function
        #set computer' score to 0
        #set player's score to 0
        #while player's score is less than 3 and computer's score is less than 2: -- this means that the game is still on
    
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here)
        #player's choice = input(ask player to select rock, paper, or scissors)
    
        #start checking user oprions
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if player inputs 'q': --player wants to end the game set keepPlaying to False --ends the loop
        #   set keepPlaying to False --ends loop
        #   stop the loop -- whoo! break statement
    
        # else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or 
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
